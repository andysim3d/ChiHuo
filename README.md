	The query construct is based on an extended SQL syntax known as Multi-Feature and Extended Multi-Feature queries<br/><br/>

	The MF and EMF queries take advantage of the grouping variables and such that clause to avoid using multiple sub-queries and joins, and making the expression more succinct<br/><br/>

	Utilized Java as the programming language and PostgreSQL as the database
